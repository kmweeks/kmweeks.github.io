  <p>Think of it like a dating site for finding charities. You fill out a questionaire and find your perfect match.</p>
  <p>The theory is this: Many people may want to give, but are worried that their money will not make an impact. What's My Charity leverages research done by various organizations to provide quality, relevant options.</p>

    <p>As a responsive site, What's My Charity needs to adapt to all screen sizes. It is mobile-first, so additional components like the callouts in the sidebar are added as the screen size increases, rather than removing items to fit a smaller screen size.</p>

    <p>The questionaire is the most important process, so the callouts are placed below the questionaire to encourage the user to complete the process. Notice the subtle fade at the bottom of the screen. It helps indicate to the user that the questionaire continues.</p>
