  <p>As a triathlete, I often do repetitive workouts - swim sets, trainer workouts on the bike, repeats on the track.</p>
  <p>I thought of an app that would allow you to save these workouts by recording the various steps needed to complete them (e.g. 5 sets of 10 pushups).</p>

    <p>I took design cues from the new iOS7 design, and utilized the icon and typography style for the UI. The app is beautiful, allowing you to focus on the workout at hand.</p>
